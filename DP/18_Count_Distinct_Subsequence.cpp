The seven distinct subsequences are "", "g", "f","gf", "fg", "gg" and "gfg"

Input  : str = "ggg"

NOTE: The count is subsequence in a string of size 'n' => nC0 + nC1 + nC2 + â€¦ nCn = 2^n
Ex:
C1: Non repeating characters in string
"abc" => "","a","b","c","ab","bc","ac","abc"
dp[i] => dp[i-1]*2

C2: Repeating characters in string
But this formula cannot be generalised for counting distinct subsequences as strings like "aba"
contains repeated character, which leads to repeated count subsequences.
"aba" => "","a","b","a","ab","ba","aa","aba" (Repeating subsequence: "a")
      => "","a","b","ab","ba","aa","aba"   (Distinct Subsequence)
dp[i] => dp[i-1]*2 - dp[lastOcc-1]

NOTE:
- If current character is repeating and gets its lastOcc index using map.In this case, we need to avoid
overcounting the subsequences that include this repeating character multiple times.
- So, we subtract the number of subsequences formed by including this character at its last occurrence
index (lastOcc).
- The reason for subtracting dp[lastOcc - 1] is that we need to exclude all subsequences formed by
including this character before its last occurrence, as they will be counted twice if we just double dp[i - 1].
